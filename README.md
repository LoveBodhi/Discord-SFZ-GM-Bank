# The Discord SFZ General MIDI Bank
A free General MIDI soundbank in native SFZ format


## Purpose
At this moment, there is no dedicated free GM bank in SFZ format for use to quickly play MIDi files that are available on the internet.
So this project try to create one SFZ GM bank with good quality by using available free/opensource samples.
Then the finished product will be shared free for everybody who like use SFZ and GM format.

## Target engines
- Plogue Sforzando
- Paul Ferrand sfizz
- Un4seen BASSMIDI

## Samples size
The limit size for the bank is not yet decided as it will depend on the used samples, but the choosen audio quality is 16-bit 44.1 kHz Wav, and will be converted to Flac format for the final version.
The concept is to keep the size at lowest as possible for fast loading and lower memory consumption, which is the typical of GM sound bank.
This will be affecting the preset design which, the original used samples maybe trimmed down and looped for some instruments type, but then will be programmed to achieve the best result.

## Sources
The sources of the samples may expand along this project goes on.
Here are list of the sources that consudered to be used:
- Versilian Studios VCSL
- Versilian Studios VSCO CE
- Salamander Grand Piano
- MSLP Samples
