# The Discord SFZ General MIDI Bank
A free General MIDI soundbank in native SFZ format


#Purpose
At this moment, there is no dedicated free GM bank in SFZ format for use to quickly play MIDi files that are available on the internet.
So this project try to create one SFZ GM bank with good quality by using available free/opensource samples.
Then the finished product will be shared free for everybody who like use SFZ and GM format.

#Target engines
- Plogue Sforzando
- Paul Ferrand sfizz
- Un4seen BASSMIDI

#Samples size
The limit size for the bank is not yet decided as it will depend on the used samples.
But the concept is to keep the size at lowest as possible for fast loading and lower memory consumption, which is the typical of GM 

sound bank. This will be affecting the preset design which, the original used samples maybe trimmed down and looped for some 

instruments type, but then will be programmed to achieve the best result.

#Sources
The source of the samples may expand along this project goes on.
We list here all the sources that have been used and more details will be added later :
- Versilian Studios VCSL
- Versilian Studios VCSO CE
